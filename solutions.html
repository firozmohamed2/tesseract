      <p>
        1. Colligative properties are properties of solution which depend on the
        number of solute particles in the solution irrespective of their nature.

        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          Ans: a) The important colligative properties are Relative lowering of
          vapour pressure, Elevation of boiling point, Depression of freezing
          point, Osmotic pressure.

          [MARCH 2010]
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          Ans: b) Ethanoic acid (acetic acid) dimerises in benzene. So the no.
          of particles decreases and hence the colligative properties decreases.

          [MARCH2011]

        <p class="answer">
          Ans: a) These are properties which depend on the number of solute
          particles and not on their nature.

          [MARCH2011]
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          Ans: b) Polymers have poor solubility and so their solution is very
          dilute. The magnitude of osmotic pressure is large even for very
          dilute solutions. So osmotic pressure measurement is used for the
          determination of their molar mass.

          >
          [MARCH2011]
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          Ans: c) This is because our blood cells are isotonic with 0.9%
          (mass/volume) NaCl solution. So osmosis does not occur if we place the
          blood cells in this solution. (If the blood cells are placed in NaCl
          solution with higher or lower concentrations than 0.9 %, they would
          shrink or swell).

        <p class="answer">
          Ans: a) Relative lowering of Vapour pressure, \(\frac{P_0 - P_s}{P_0}
          = x_2\), the mole fraction of the solute.<br />
          Here relative lowering of vapour pressure of glucose = 0.018. So its
          mole fraction = 0.018.

        <p class="answer">
          Ans: b) Here b.p of solution (\(T_b\)) = 373.052 K and that of water
          (\(T_b^0\)) = 373 K.<br />
          Elevation of b.p, \(\Delta T_b = T_b - T_b^0 = 373.052 - 373 = 0.052
          \, K\);<br />
          We know that, \(\Delta T_b = K_b \cdot m\)<br />
          So, molality, \(m = \frac{\Delta T_b}{K_b} = \frac{0.052}{0.52} = 0.1
          \, mol \, kg^{-1}\)<br />
          The depression in freezing point, \(\Delta T_f = K_f \cdot m = 1.86
          \times 0.1 = 0.186 \, K\)<br />
          Also, \(\Delta T_f = T_f^0 - T_f\)<br />
          So, freezing point of the solution (\(T_f\)) = \(T_f^0 - \Delta T_f =
          273 - 0.186 = 272.814 \, K\)
