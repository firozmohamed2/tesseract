    <h2>CHEMISTRY - MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>1. State Henry's law. Give its mathematical form.</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: Henry's law states that at constant temperature, the solubility of a
      gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas.
      Mathematically, $p = K_H \cdot X$ (where $p$ is the partial pressure, $X$
      is the mole fraction and $K_H$ is the Henry's law constant).
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>2. Write any two applications of Henry's law.</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: (i) In the preparation of soda water and soft drinks. (ii) A medical
      condition known as Bends in Scuba divers.
    </div>

    <div class="question"><strong>3. State Raoult’s law.</strong></div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: The law states that for a solution of volatile liquids, the partial
      vapour pressure of each component in the solution is directly proportional
      to its mole fraction present in solution. Mathematically, $p_i = p_i^0
      \cdot x_i$.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong
        >4. What are ideal solutions? Write any two properties of ideal
        solutions. Give one example for such solution.</strong
      >
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: These are solutions which obey Raoult’s law at all concentrations.
      For an ideal solution, $p_i = p_i^0 \cdot x_i$, $\Delta_{mix}H = 0$ and
      $\Delta_{mix}V = 0$. E.g. is a mixture of benzene and toluene.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>5. What are non-ideal solutions?</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: These are solutions which do not obey Raoult’s law at all
      concentrations. For such solutions, $p_i \neq p_i^0 \cdot x_i$,
      $\Delta_{mix}H \neq 0$ and $\Delta_{mix}V \neq 0$.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong
        >6. What type of deviation is shown by a mixture of chloroform and
        acetone? Give reason.</strong
      >
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: Negative deviation. Chloroform can form hydrogen bond with acetone.
      So, the solute - solvent interaction increases and hence the vapour
      pressure decreases.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong
        >7. Draw a vapour pressure curve, by plotting vapour pressure against
        mole fraction for: (i) an ideal solution (ii) a solution that show
        positive deviation from Raoult’s law (iii) A solution that show negative
        deviation from Raoult’s law.</strong
      >
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: (i) Ideal solution: A straight line graph showing partial pressures
      of components and total pressure as a function of mole fraction. (ii)
      Positive deviation from Raoult’s law: Curves showing partial pressures and
      total pressure are higher than those predicted by Raoult's law. (iii)
      Negative deviation from Raoult’s law: Curves showing partial pressures and
      total pressure are lower than those predicted by Raoult's law.
    </div>

    <div class="question"><strong>8. What are azeotropes?</strong></div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: They are constant boiling mixtures and have the same composition in
      liquid and vapour phases.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>9. Explain the different types of azeotropes?</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans : There are 2 types of azeotropes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Minimum boiling azeotropes:</strong> Formed by solutions which
          show large positive deviation from Raoult’s law. E.g. 95% aqueous
          solution of ethanol by volume.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maximum boiling azeotrope:</strong> Formed by solutions which
          show large negative deviation from Raoult’s law. E.g. 68% aqueous
          solution of $HNO_3$ by mass.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong
        >10. What are colligative properties? Name the four types of colligative
        properties.</strong
      >
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: These are properties of dilute solutions, which depend only on the
      number of solute particles and not on their nature. The important
      colligative properties:
      <ol>
        <li>Relative lowering of Vapour pressure</li>
        <li>Elevation of boiling point</li>
        <li>Depression of freezing point</li>
        <li>Osmotic pressure.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="question"><strong>11. What is osmotic pressure?</strong></div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: It is the excess pressure that must be applied on solution side to
      prevent osmosis.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong
        >12. What is reverse osmosis? Write any one of its applications.</strong
      >
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: If a pressure larger than the osmotic pressure is applied to the
      solution side, the direction of osmosis gets reversed. Now, the solvent
      molecules will flow out of solution through SPM. This is known as reverse
      osmosis. It is used in desalination of sea water.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong
        >13. For determining the molecular mass of polymers, osmotic pressure is
        preferred to other properties. Why?</strong
      >
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: This is because the magnitude of osmotic pressure is large even for
      very dilute solutions.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong
        >14. Write any 2 advantages of osmotic pressure measurement over other
        colligative property measurements?</strong
      >
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: (i) Osmotic pressure can be measured at room temperature. (ii) Here
      molarity of the solution is used instead of molality, which can be
      determined easily.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>15. What are isotonic solutions? Give an example.</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: Two solutions having same osmotic pressure are called isotonic
      solutions. E.g. 0.9% (mass/volume) NaCl solution and our blood cells.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong
        >16. For intravenous injections only solutions with osmotic pressure
        equal to that of 0.9% NaCl solution is used. Why?</strong
      >
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: This is because the fluid inside our blood cell is isotonic with 0.9%
      (mass/volume) NaCl solution. So, osmosis does not occur.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong
        >17. Define van’t Hoff factor. What is its value for KCl solution, if
        there is 100% dissociation.</strong
      >
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: van't Hoff factor (i) = $\frac{\text{Normal molar
      mass}}{\text{Abnormal molar mass}}$. For KCl, i=2.

    <div class="question">
      <strong
        >18. What happens to the colligative properties when ethanoic acid is
        treated with benzene? Give reason.</strong
      >
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: Colligative properties decrease. This is because ethanoic acid
      (acetic acid) dimerise in benzene, due to hydrogen bonding.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong
        >19. 200 cm³ of aqueous solution of a protein contains 1.26 g of
        protein. The osmotic pressure of the solution at 300 K is found to be
        8.3 x 10⁻² bar. Calculate the molar mass of protein. (R = 0.083 L bar
        K⁻¹ mol⁻¹)</strong
      >
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: Here $w_2 = 1.26$ g, $R = 0.083$ L bar/K/mol, $\pi = 8.3 \times
      10^{-2}$ bar, $T = 300$ K & $V = 200 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.2$ L We know that,
      molar mass of solute, $M_2 = \frac{w_2 \cdot R \cdot T}{\pi \cdot V} =
      \frac{1.26 \times 0.083 \times 300}{8.3 \times 10^{-2} \times 0.2} = 1890
      \, \text{g/mol}$.

        >20. 18g of glucose, $C_6H_{12}O_6$, is dissolved in 1 kg of water in a
        sauce pan. At what temperature will water boil at 1.013 bar? ($K_b$ for
        water is 0.52 K kg mol⁻¹, boiling point of water = 373.15 K)</strong
      >
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: We know that, $\Delta T_b = \frac{1000 \cdot K_b \cdot w_2}{M_2 \cdot
      w_1}$ Here $w_2 = 18$ g, $w_1 = 1$ kg = 1000 g, $K_b = 0.52$ K kg/mol,
      $M_2 = 180$, $T_b^0 = 373.15$ K, $\Delta T_b = ?$ , $T_b = ?$ On
      substituting in the above equation, we get $\Delta T_b = \frac{1000 \times
      0.52 \times 18}{180 \times 1000} = 0.052 \, \text{K}$ Also, $T_b = \Delta
      T_b + T_b^0 = 0.052 + 373.15 = 373.202 \, \text{K}$.

      >
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: The molar conductivity increases with dilution for both strong and
      weak electrolytes. This is due to the increase in ionic mobility for
      strong electrolytes and increase in degree of dissociation for weak
      electrolytes.

    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Ans: For a first order reaction, $k = \frac{2.303}{t} \log
      \frac{[R]_0}{[R]}$.<br />
      When $t = t_{1/2}$, $[R] = \frac{[R]_0}{2}$.<br />
      So, $k = \frac{2.303}{t_{1/2}} \log \frac{[R]_0}{[R]_0/2} =
      \frac{2.303}{t_{1/2}} \log 2 = \frac{2.303 \times 0.3010}{t_{1/2}} =
      \frac{0.693}{t_{1/2}}$.<br />
      Or, $t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{k}$.<br />
      Thus, for a first order reaction, half-life period is independent of
      initial concentration of the reactants.
